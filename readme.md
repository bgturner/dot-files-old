A lot of this has been taken from others. Mostly [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles).

## Install

I clone this repo directly into my home directory and execute the install script:

```
git clone git@github.com:bgturner/dot-files.git .dot-files
cd .dot-files
./install-dotfiles.sh
```

This will copy down the repo, backup the various dot-files in my home directory, and then create symlinks to the files within this repo.
